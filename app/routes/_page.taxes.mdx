1. Primary Entity: U.S. LLC (100% foreign-owned)
   ✅ Already done or in progress.

Use it to collect payments (Stripe, PayPal, clients, platforms)

Treated as a disregarded entity → pass-through → tax responsibility shifts to you personally

You don’t automatically owe U.S. tax unless you have Effectively Connected Income (ECI)

🔥 Your obligations:
EIN (done via IRS)

Annual Form 5472 + Pro Forma 1120 (or you get a $25,000 fine)

No U.S. state income tax if formed in a no-tax state (e.g. Wyoming, New Mexico)

File W-8BEN with platforms to avoid 30% withholding

➡️ This is your “front-end” entity. Clean, bankable, and platform-compatible.

2. Banking Stack (Multi-jurisdiction)
   U.S.:

🔹 Mercury (default) or Relay

🔹 Wise (for international wires & local currency accounts)

HK or Singapore:

🔹 Airwallex / Statrys / Neat

🔹 Adds Asia-based clients/payments to your pipeline

Crypto-native fallback:

🔹 Binance (P2P bridge), Kraken, or CoinEx

🔹 Ledger + offshore entity for true sovereignty

Europe backup:

🔹 Revolut Business / Payoneer

🔹 Helps for EUR clients or affiliate payouts

3. Secondary Entity (Advanced Layer)
   Once you’re earning $100K+/yr and want to route intelligently:

Option A: HK Limited Company
Familiar to Chinese nationals

Acceptable globally

No corporate tax on offshore income if structured cleanly

Pair with crypto + invoice routing

Option B: UAE Free Zone Entity (e.g., IFZA, Meydan)
0% corporate + personal tax

Access to UAE banking, residency

You can live anywhere, but legally be UAE-based

Option C: BVI/Belize LLC
Total privacy

Great for holding crypto + IP

Combine with U.S. LLC for frontend, BVI for backend asset flow

4. Tax Residency Game (Optional, but Freedom Critical)
   Right now, you're tax-resident in China = full liability on worldwide income.

To break that:

Exit Chinese tax residency (takes time, depends on days present)

Establish residency in a 0% or low-tax jurisdiction:

🇦🇪 UAE (if you’re ready to go)

🇵🇦 Panama (Friendly Nations visa)

🇵🇹 Portugal (NHR used to be good, now mostly dead)

🇬🇪 Georgia (open, friendly, flat tax on foreign income)

🇲🇾 Malaysia (MM2H, more passive but viable)

This gives you legal tax optimization + mobility. The goal is:

“Don’t live where you pay. Don’t earn where you live. Don’t keep where you earn.”

5. Payments + Payout Defense
   You need to diversify before shit goes down.

Use Case Tools
Card Payments Stripe (U.S. LLC)
Invoicing Wise, Payoneer, Paddle (reseller)
Crypto USDT/BTC/ETH (Binance, Tron, etc.)
Affiliate/Platform Revolut, Deel, Wise

Don't tie yourself to one processor. Have at least:

2 bank accounts

1 crypto wallet (cold + hot)

2 payment platforms (Stripe + Paddle or Gumroad)

6. Holdings & Asset Layer (Protect the Backend)
   Once you hit >$100K in liquid assets:

Open a Trust or offshore LLC to hold long-term crypto/stocks/IP

Never hold everything in one name or country

7. Compliance Automation
   Bookkeeping: Xero, QuickBooks, or Bullet (if UAE)

Auto-tax planning: Found, Lili (U.S. only), or Outsourced CPA

File 5472 annually, or pay a killer fine

If you're earning >$50K, hire a CPA for an hour and automate everything.

📌 TL;DR: THE STACK
Layer Tool/Setup
Entity U.S. LLC (SP)
Bank Mercury + Wise
Payments Stripe, PayPal, Paddle
Secondary UAE or HK entity (later)
Residency UAE / Panama / Georgia
Tax Strategy No ECI in U.S., exit CN tax
Compliance File 5472, no personal/biz mix
Assets Offshore wallet + trust (later)

💥 Your Action Plan (Now)
File W-8BEN with every platform (to avoid U.S. 30% withholding)

Track every dollar in your biz bank (no co-mingling)

File 5472 + 1120 before the U.S. deadline

Set aside taxes (if China still claims you as resident)

When income > $100K or you're stable: add offshore structure + residency escape route
